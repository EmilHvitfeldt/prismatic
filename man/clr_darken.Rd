\usage{
clr_darken(col, shift = 0.5, space = c("HCL", "HSL", "combined"))
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{a color object or vector of any of the three kinds of R color
specifications, i.e., either a color name (as listed by colors()), a
hexadecimal string of the form "#rrggbb" or "#rrggbbaa" (see rgb), or a
positive integer i meaning palette()[i].}

\item{shift}{Numeric between 0 and 1, 0 will do zero darkening, 1 will do
complete darkening turning the color to black. Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{space}{character string specifying the color space in which adjustment
happens. Can be either "HCL", "HSL" or "combined". Defaults to "HCL".}
}
\value{
a color object of same length as col.
}

Make a color more dark

\details{
The colors will be transformed to HSL color space (hue, saturation,
 lightness) where the lightness of the color will  be modified. The lightness
 of a color takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 being black and 1 being
 white. The \code{shift} argument takes a value between 0 and 1, where 0
 means that the lightness stays unchanged and 1 means completely black. As an
 example, if the lightness of the color is 0.6 and shift is 0.5, then the
 lightness be set to the halfway point between 0.6 and 0, which is 0.3.

If space = "HSL" then the colors are transformed to HSL space where
  the lightness value L is adjusted. If space = "HCL" then the colors are
  transformed to Cylindrical HCL space where the luminance value L is
  adjusted. If space = "combined" then the colors are transformed into HSL and
  Cylindrical HCL space. Where the color adjusting is happening HLS is copied
  to the values in the HCL transformation. Thus the "combined" transformation
  adjusts the luminance in HCL space and chroma in HSL space. For more
  information regarding use of color spaces, please refer to the colorspace

# Using linear shift
plot(clr_darken(rep("red", 11), shift = seq(0, 1, 0.1)))
plot(clr_darken(rep("red", 11), shift = seq(0, 1, 0.1), space = "HSL"))
plot(clr_darken(rep("red", 11), shift = seq(0, 1, 0.1), space = "combined"))

plot(clr_darken(terrain.colors(10)))

# Using exponential shifts
plot(clr_darken(rep("red", 11), shift = log(seq(1, exp(1), length.out = 11))))
