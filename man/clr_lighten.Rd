\usage{
clr_lighten(col, shift = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{a color object or vector of any of the three kinds of R color
specifications, i.e., either a color name (as listed by colors()), a
hexadecimal string of the form "#rrggbb" or "#rrggbbaa" (see rgb), or a
positive integer i meaning palette()[i].}

\item{shift}{Numeric between 0 and 1, 0 will do zero lightening, 1 will do
complete lightening turning the color to white. Defaults to 0.5.}
}
\value{
a color object of same length as col.
}

Make a color more light
}
\details{
The colors will be trainsformed to HSL color space (hue, saturation,
 lightness) where the lightness of the color will  be modified. The lightness
 of a color takes a value between 0 and 1, with 0 being black and 1 being
 white. The \code{shift} argument takes a value between 0 and 1, where 0
 means that the lightness stays unchanged and 1 means completely white. As an
 example, if the lightness of the color is 0.6 and shift is 0.5, then the
 lightness be set to the halfway point between 0.6 and 1 which is 0.8.

\examples{
# Using linear shift
plot(clr_lighten(rep("red", 11), shift = seq(0, 1, 0.1)))

# Using exponential shifts
plot(clr_lighten(rep("red", 11), shift = log(seq(1, exp(1), length.out = 11))))
