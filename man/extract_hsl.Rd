\usage{
clr_extract_hue(col)

clr_extract_saturation(col)

clr_extract_lightness(col)
}
\arguments{
\item{col}{a color object or vector of any of the three kinds of R color
specifications, i.e., either a color name (as listed by colors()), a
hexadecimal string of the form "#rrggbb" or "#rrggbbaa" (see rgb), or a
positive integer i meaning palette()[i].}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of values.
}
\description{
Extract the hue, saturation, or lightness color components from a vector of
colors.
}
\details{
The range of the value are

- hue ranges from 0 to 360. in a circular fashion such that 0 and 360 are
  near identical. 0 is red
- saturation ranges from 0 to 100. 100 is full saturation, 0 is no saturation
- lightness ranges from 0 to 100. 100 is full lightness, 0 is no lightness

Use [clr_extract()] if you are planning to extractionn multiple components.
